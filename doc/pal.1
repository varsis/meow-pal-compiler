.SH DESCRIPTION
Parses a
.B PAL
program and is able to detect some errors based on syntax. Does
semantic checking of program code as well, but does not
generate code. PAL will eventually compile programs to the
ASC pseudo-assembly language. Written primarily in C++, and 
uses the Bison and Flex compiler tools.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -n
Do not produce a program listing. Default is to produce one.
.IP -d
Turns on verbose debugging for Bison.
.IP -S
Leaves Asc code in FILE.asc instead of removing it.
.IP -a
Turns off run-time array bounds checking. Default is to do run-time
array bounds checking.
.IP -p
Prints the output to standard output instead of to the listing file.
Overrides the -n option.
.SH EXAMPLES
.B pal FILE  :
Will compile the PAL program in FILE. Will print program listing,
remove Asc code, and do run-time array bounds checking, as per the
default. Will print errors in-line with the program listing. Option -n
will suppress the program listing but not the error messages. Option
-p will send the output to stdout rather than the listing file.

.SH BUGS
Does not compile code.
