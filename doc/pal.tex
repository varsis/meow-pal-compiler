% From checkpoint 1 spec:
%
% Documentation
%
% Your documentation should describe what your group has done on the
% project. This does not mean that you should reiterate class notes; I want to
% know what is different about your group. Some things you may want to discuss
% include: handling of lexical units, syntax error reporting strategies, syntax
% error recovery (if any) , problems encountered and their solutions, etc.
% When writing, remember who is going to read itâ€”skip the preli minaries
% and get to the point. There is a page limit of 12 double-spaced pages,
% not in cluding diagrams.
