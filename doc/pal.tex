\maketitle

% From checkpoint 1 spec:
%
% Documentation
%
% Your documentation should describe what your group has done on the
% project. This does not mean that you should reiterate class notes; I want to
% know what is different about your group. Some things you may want to discuss
% include: handling of lexical units, syntax error reporting strategies, syntax
% error recovery (if any) , problems encountered and their solutions, etc.
% When writing, remember who is going to read itâ€”skip the preli minaries
% and get to the point. There is a page limit of 12 double-spaced pages,
% not in cluding diagrams.

\section*{Overview}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure}

At this stage, our compiler source consists of 6 classes. The \texttt{Compiler} class is instantiated by 
the program's \texttt{main()} function, and ran with the program's given command line arguments. 

The \texttt{Compiler} class creates an \texttt{ErrorManager}
class which tracks errors as they are detected while parsing the file. It passes the \texttt{ErrorManager}
to the \texttt{Parser} class when it is constructed.

The \texttt{Parser} class is a wrapper for the \texttt{flex} and \texttt{bison}
generated \texttt{PalScanner} and \texttt{PalParser} classes, from the
\texttt{pal.lex} and \texttt{pal.y} sources, respectively. \texttt{Parser}
parses a file with \texttt{parseFile(fileName)}, which creates a
\texttt{PalScanner} and \texttt{PalParser} where the scanner runs through
the file and feeds the parser with a stream of tokens.  The scanner and
parser are given access to the common \texttt{ErrorManager}, and when they
encounter errors during lexical and syntactical analysis, they create new
\texttt{Error} objects with the appropriate error code and line number and
give them to the \texttt{ErrorManager}.

When parsing is finished, the \texttt{Compiler} takes the errors accumulated by the \texttt{ErrorManager}
and either displays them inline with the program listing, or all errors in order of appearance without 
the program listing if \texttt{pal} was invoked with the \texttt{-n} option.
