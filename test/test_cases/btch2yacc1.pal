	Cmput 415 - Team YACC
	Checkpoint 2 Test 1.pal
	Testing lexor to see if compiler recongizes comparison operators
		as one or two tokens when seperated by space, comment, tab.
		We give correct input for 3 lines after each error, this allows
		enought correct tokens to recover in time to catch each subsequent error.
	Errors:
		- space between < = in line 18
		- comment between < = in line 23	
		- tab between < = in line 28
