Test cases should try to follow these naming conventions:

 - Test files should start with a 'b' or a 'v', represention whether
   the file is broken or valid.

 - The second letter of test files names denote its general
   purpose. These include 'f' for future tests, 's' for stress tests,
   't' for targeted tests (things that are testing a certain part of
   the grammar or compiler; usually relatively short), 'r' for random
   test cases (random programs that will aim for quantity, not
   quality), and 'c' for the crazy test files.

 - Following the first two letters, the files name should tell what
   the file does or tests. Examples: vrFibonacci.pal,
   btArrayDecl2.pal, etc...

The scripts may use some of these letters, so beware!
